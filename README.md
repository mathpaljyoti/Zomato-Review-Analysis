# Zomato-Review-Analysis
Sentiment Analysis on Zomato Reviews using Logistic Regression

This project aims to analyze Zomato reviews to determine whether the content on a user's feed is positive or negative. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques, the model classifies reviews as positive or negative based on the sentiment expressed.

## Features üåü
- Sentiment Analysis of Zomato reviews.
- Uses NLP techniques to preprocess and clean textual data.
- Trained on a large dataset to ensure high accuracy.
- Model accuracy: **97.13%**
- Confusion Matrix and Classification Report included for performance evaluation.

## Dataset üìä
The dataset used for this project was obtained from **Kaggle**. You can access the dataset using the link below:
(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prepinstaprime/tomato-reviews)

The dataset contains a large number of reviews along with their sentiments (positive/negative), which were used to train and evaluate the model.
